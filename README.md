# StreamDeckV3

3rd or idk which itteration of my StreamDeck app. First version was written in completly SvelteKit, where you would expect to run the NodeServer on your machine, and open UI in browser. It was a pain to use, and nov even work. Then I tried to write second itteration, but somehow didn't finsihed it. Now I'm trying to write the native app with Tauri, Svelte as frontend and Rust as backend.
